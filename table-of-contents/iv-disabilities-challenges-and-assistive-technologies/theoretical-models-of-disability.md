Theoretical models of disability provide perspectives and frameworks through which to understand disability. No model is comprehensive, so can be neither fully correct nor incorrect. Each has strengths as well as limitations. In practice, organizations generally make use of aspects of multiple models, in particular the social and medical models.

## Medical Model

### Definitions

**From Disabled World**: *“The medical model is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a ‘cure,’ or the individual’s adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an ‘almost-cure’ or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming health care policy.”*

**From the US National Institutes of Health**: *“One result of the common medical understanding of disability is that people with disabilities often report feeling excluded, undervalued, pressured to fit a questionable norm, and / or treated as if they were globally incapacitated. People with disabilities often express frustration when they are met with pitying attitudes or incredulity if they speak about anything positive related to living with their conditions.”*

**From the University of Leicester, UK**: *“The medical model of disability views disability as a ‘problem’ that belongs to the disabled individual. It is not seen as an issue to concern anyone other than the individual affected. For example, if a wheelchair-using student is unable to get into a building because of some steps, the medical model would suggest that this is because of the wheelchair, rather than the steps.”*

### Strengths

The medical model can address the biological sources of disabilities, either by clinically curing them or providing ways to medically manage the conditions. The medical component of disabilities is a critical reality for many people.

### Weaknesses

The medical model treats disability as a problem or inherent characteristic of the individual and seeks a cure or medical management of a bodily condition, often overlooking the broader sociopolitical constraints imposed by unwelcoming or inaccessible environments.

## Social Model

### Definitions

**From Disabled World**: *“The social model of disability sees the issue of ‘disability’ as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment. Hence, the management of the problem requires social action and is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both cultural and ideological, requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment / disability is a human rights issue of major concern.”*

**From the University of Leicester, UK**: *“This model draws on the idea that it is society that disables people, through designing everything to meet the needs of the majority of people who are not disabled. There is a recognition within the social model that there is a great deal that society can do to reduce, and ultimately remove, some of these disabling barriers, and that this task is the responsibility of society, rather than the disabled person. The social model is more inclusive in approach, as pro-active thought is given to how disabled people can participate in activities on an equal footing with non-disabled people. Certain adjustments are made, even where this involves time or money, to ensure that disabled people are not excluded. The onus is on the organiser of the event or activity to make sure that their activity is accessible. Examples might be:*

- A course leader who meets with a visually impaired member of the group before the beginning of a course to find out how hand-outs can be adapted so that the student can read them;
- A member of staff who makes PowerPoint presentations available on Blackboard to all members of the group before a lecture. This allows dyslexic students to look up unfamiliar terminology before the lecture and gives them an idea of the structure that will be followed. This ‘framing’ helps students to understand and retain the information;
- A Students’ Union society that consults with disabled members before organising an event in order to make sure that the venue is accessible.”
  
For disability advocates the social model of disability has become a rallying cry for social justice.

### Strengths

The social model’s focus on the disabling conditions in the environment and in society makes it clear that the barriers and challenges experienced by people with disabilities are not inevitable, nor are they exclusively a characteristic of the individual’s “broken” body. Societies can improve the lives of people with disabilities considerably by ensuring that the world is designed to accommodate a wide range of human characteristics and abilities.

### Weaknesses

The social model of disability can tend to downplay the embodied aspects of disabilities too much, as if disability had nothing to do with bodily characteristics at all. The social model’s push for social justice in the political arena can also put activists at odds with people with other political interests, antagonizing relationships and sometimes creating resolute political adversaries.

## Biopsychosocial Model

### Definition

In 2002, the World Health Organization published the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which describes the complex phenomenon of disability and integrates the social and medical models:

“*A better model of disability, in short, is one that synthesizes what is true in the medical and social models, without making the mistake each makes in reducing the whole, complex notion of disability to one of its aspects. This more useful model of disability might be called the biopsychosocial model. ICF is based on this model, an integration of medical and social. ICF provides, by this synthesis, a coherent view of different perspectives of health: biological, individual and social*”.

## Economic Model

### Definition

**From Disabled World**: *“The economic model of disability defines disability by a person’s inability to participate in work. It also assesses the degree to which impairment affects an individual’s productivity and the economic consequences for the individual, employer and the state. Such consequences include loss of earnings for and payment for assistance by the individual; lower profit margins for the employer; and state welfare payments. This model is directly related to the charity model.”*

### Strengths

The economic model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person’s ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support and / or accommodations for the person’s disability.

### Weaknesses

The economic model creates a legally defined category of people who are needy, which can be stigmatizing for people with disabilities. Also, if a person doesn’t meet the legal threshold for disabled, or if there is a dispute as to a person’s disability, the person with the disability may not receive the support they need.

## Functional Solutions Model

#### Definition

The functional solutions model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or “functional impairments”) due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship.

### Strengths

The strongest aspect of this model is that it is results-oriented. It seeks to provide solutions to real-world challenges, while sidestepping the often-convoluted sociopolitical implications of disability within society.

### Weaknesses

When new technologies are involved, profit-driven entrepreneurs can sometimes miss the mark, creating products that may be innovative but not practical or useful, or which may be of more benefit to the innovators than to the target population, especially if the proposed solutions are expensive. Also, when the primary cause of a particular challenge is the socioeconomic circumstances in the environment, the functional solutions model’s de-emphasis on socioeconomic issues can cause would-be innovators to ignore the most important aspects of the original problem.

## Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model

### Definition

The social identity or cultural affiliation model refers to a sense of deriving one’s personal identity from membership within a group of like-minded individuals. This model is most evident among people who are deaf, because of their shared linguistic experience as sign language users. For example, Deaf culture and identity owes much of its strength to the somewhat exclusive nature of being a part of a close-knit linguistic minority.
Other people with disabilities may also feel a sense of belonging to a community with common life experiences and interests.

### Strengths

The social identity or cultural affiliation model accepts the person’s disability completely and uses it as a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.

### Weaknesses

The sense of belonging felt by one group of people can be counterbalanced by a feeling of exclusion by people who don’t fit the group’s expectations.

## Charity Model

### Definition

The charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.

### Strengths

The charity model can inspire people to contribute their time and / or resources to provide assistance when it is genuinely needed.

### Weaknesses

The charity model can be condescending toward people with disabilities, who may come to resent the feeling that they are the object of pity by other people, and that they must depend on accepting or cultivating this pity on a continual basis. The charity model often focuses on short-term, immediate needs, often at the expense of more comprehensive, and ultimately more effective, long-term solutions.

Several models of defining disability have been developed to try to address the many types of disabilities.  Models of disability provide a reference for society as programs and services, laws, regulations and structures are developed, which affect the lives of people living with a disability.  The primary models of disability used are the Medical Model, Functional Model, and Social Model.

**Medical Model** – The medical model describes disability as a consequence of a health condition, disease or caused by a trauma that can disrupt the functioning of a person in a physiological or cognitive way.14  This model is a conceptualization of disability as a condition a person has and focuses on the prevention, treatment or curing of the disabling condition.

**Functional Model** – This model is similar to the medical model in that it conceptualizes disability as an impairment or deficit. Disability is caused by physical, medical or cognitive deficits. The disability itself limits a person’s functioning or the ability to perform functional activities.

**Social Model** – This model focuses on barriers facing people with disabilities instead of concentrating on impairments and deficits of the person with a disability.  In this model a person’s activities are limited not by the impairment or condition but by environment and barriers are consequences of a lack of social organization.14
