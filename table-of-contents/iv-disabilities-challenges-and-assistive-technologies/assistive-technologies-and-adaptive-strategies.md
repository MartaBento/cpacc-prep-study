# Introduction

Assistive technologies are products used by people with disabilities to help accomplish tasks which they could not accomplish otherwise. When used with computers, assistive technologies are also referred to as adaptive technologies or adaptive software. Some assistive technologies rely on the output of other user agents, such as graphical desktop browsers, text browsers, voice browsers, multimedia players, and plug-ins.

Adaptive strategies are solutions meant to help people with disabilities perform activities of daily living and increase their independence and ability to participate in society. Adaptive strategies provide enhancements to, or change the methods of, interacting with the environment or technology needed to accomplish a task.

# Visual Disabilities Assistive Technologies and Adaptive Strategies

## Blindness and Low Vision Challenges and Solutions

**Cannot see, or difficult to see, digital or electronic interfaces:**

- Screen readers can read interfaces and content out loud by converting text to speech.
- Audio description is an additional audio track that describes and gives context for essential visual information.

**Cannot use screen readers on interfaces and digital content not designed with accessibility in mind:**

- Interfaces and content must be remediated for accessibility. Interface designers and content authors, if they have access to the necessary files, can edit the markup (which describes the files’ presentation or logical structure) to make them compatible with assistive technologies.

**Cannot see digital interfaces of public displays, such as digital signs, ATMs, and airport kiosks:**

- Content should also be announced audibly. On interactive systems, haptic or speech input can facilitate interaction.

**Has difficulty seeing low contrast text:**

- Software or hardware options can enhance the contrast of digital text by using color combinations with high enough contrast to easily read.

**Cannot see when walking:**

- Canes help people feel their surroundings as they walk.
- Trained service animals help people navigate.
- GPS-based walking instructions with an audio interface, either automated or via a remote human navigator, help people navigate.
- Use raised tiles on the ground to indicate the edge of a platform, a pathway along a sidewalk, the beginning of a staircase, etc. Eliminate low-hanging architectural features that a blind person could bump into.
- Clear obstructions in hallways and on sidewalks.

**Cannot see, or has difficulty seeing, signs or other text on buildings or other locations:**

- Map and geolocation applications on mobile devices can announce the names and descriptions of buildings and other location-related information.
- If they are easy to find, braille labels and descriptions on entrances, rooms, bathrooms, historical markers, and other points of interest allow people who know braille to explore and understand their surroundings.
- Tactile models of the exterior of buildings, or of floor plans of the interior of buildings, help people form a mental map of their surroundings.
- Use color combinations with high contrast.

**Cannot see or feel the controls on flat interfaces on devices such as microwaves and dishwashers:**

- Use alternative interfaces with knobs or other tactile controls.
- Provide audio interfaces.
- Facilitate remote control through mobile apps.

**Cannot read the text on the containers or packaging for consumer items such as medicine, personal care products, and food:**

- Embossed braille (or braille stickers) on packaging and product containers help consumers identify items both in the store and after purchase.
- Mobile apps can scan labels of bar/QR codes and read the product information aloud.

**Cannot read money to determine its value:**

- Mobile apps can photograph the money and read the value aloud.
- Paper bills and coins should be manufactured in different sizes, shapes, or textures to allow people to distinguish the value based on touch or by using a small measuring device.
- Non-cash systems of payment can use voice output or work with screen readers.

**Cannot read books, mail, or other printed materials:**

- Optical character recognition software can convert scanned images of text into digital text readable by screen readers. Accuracy depends on the capabilities of the conversion software and the quality of the original document, including font choices and line spacing.
- Information can be placed online or in other digital formats to allow people to read the materials using their own assistive technologies.

**Cannot tell the color of a clothing item:**

- Mobile apps can recognize colors through cameras on mobile devices and speak them aloud.
