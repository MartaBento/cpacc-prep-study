# Introduction

There are many types of disabilities that affect people’s abilities to see, hear, speak, move, think and feel. This section provides information on the main categories and types of disabilities along with the barriers people with disabilities often face to full participation in society.

## Visual Disabilities

### Overview

Visual disabilities are sensory disabilities that can range from some amount of vision loss, loss of visual acuity, or increased or decreased sensitivity to specific or bright colors, to complete or uncorrectable loss of vision in either or both eyes.

`Blindness`

**Definition**: Blindness is a sensory disability involving nearly complete vision loss.

**Characteristics**: Some people are completely blind, without the ability to see anything. Others can perceive light versus dark, or the general shapes of large objects, but cannot read text or recognize people by sight.

**Demographics**: As reported by the World Health Organization Fact Sheet: Vision Impairment and Blindness:

- Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.

- The 1 billion people with vision impairment includes those with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness due to unaddressed refractive error, as well as near vision impairment caused by unaddressed presbyopia.

- Globally, the leading causes of vision impairment are uncorrected refractive errors and cataracts.

- The majority of people with vision impairment are over 50 years of age.

`Color Blindness`

**Definition**: Color blindness is a sensory disability that impairs a person’s ability to distinguish certain color combinations.

**Characteristics**: The most common forms of color-blindness affect an individual’s ability to distinguish reds and greens, although other colors may be affected.

**Demographics**: According to the US National Institutes of Health, US National Library of Medicine, Genetics Home Reference article, Color Vision Deficiency:

- Red-green color vision defects are the most common form of color vision deficiency. This condition affects males much more often than females. Among populations with Northern European ancestry, it occurs in about 1 in 12 males and 1 in 200 females. Red-green color vision defects have a lower incidence in almost all other populations studied.

- Blue-yellow color vision defects affect males and females equally. This condition occurs in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people worldwide.

Blue cone monochromacy is rarer than the other forms of color vision deficiency, affecting about 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. Like red-green color vision defects, blue cone monochromacy affects males much more often than females.

`Low Vision`

**Definition**: The American Federation for the Blind offers a functional definition:

- Low vision is uncorrectable vision loss that interferes with daily activities. It is better defined in terms of function, rather than numerical test results.

- In other words, low vision is “not enough vision to do whatever it is you need to do,” which can vary from person to person.

- Most eye care professionals prefer to use the term “low vision” to describe permanently reduced vision that cannot be corrected with regular glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery.
  
**Characteristics**: A person with low vision will typically need magnification to see well enough to read or discern other details. Some people with low vision experience low contrast, and therefore benefit from high contrast text and graphics. Some experience color deficiencies, which means they may not be able to see the difference between certain colors.

**Demographics**: According to the World Health Organization, about 246 million people, or 3.5% of the world’s population, have low vision. About 90% of people with vision impairments live in low income settings.

#### Barriers for People with Visual Disabilities

From the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative and other sources:

- Materials, such as books, restaurant menus and navigation aids, that are not made available in alternate formats such as digital files or braille.

- Speakers who do not provide descriptions that would help with navigation or understanding information otherwise conveyed visually.

- In websites and other technologies, images, controls, and other structural elements that do not provide text alternatives.

- Text, images, and page layouts that cannot be resized, or that lose information when resized.

- Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids.

- Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an audio-description track.

- Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions.

- Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations.

- Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support the use of custom color combinations.

- Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support.

## Auditory Disabilities

### Overview

Auditory disabilities are sensory disabilities that range from partial to complete hearing loss.

`Deafness`

**Definition**: Deafness is the total or near total loss of hearing.

**Characteristics**: A person who is deaf or hard of hearing has difficulty with sounds, including the audio component of multimedia materials. Many, but not all, people who are deaf know sign language. Often sign language is the first language — and therefore the most comfortable native language — of those who are born deaf. They may feel less comfortable reading printed or digital text because it is a foreign language for them, and the phonetic notation does not help their comprehension. By way of contrast, those who lose their hearing later in life may never learn sign language, or if they learn it, they may not feel as comfortable speaking in sign, and may prefer text.

`Hard of Hearing`

**Definition**: Hard of hearing (HOH) refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe, who still have some useful hearing, and may communicate through sign language, spoken language, or both understand spoken language in some situations, with or without amplification. Most HOH people can use the phone and use hearing aids.

**Characteristics**: Individuals who are hard of hearing have partially-impaired hearing in one or both ears, resulting in a mild-to-moderate hearing loss where there may be enough residual hearing that an auditory device, such as a hearing aid or FM system, provides adequate assistance to process speech. A person who hard of hearing has difficulty with sounds, including the audio component of multimedia materials.

**Demographics**: According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 466 million people, or 6.1 percent of the world’s population, are deaf or hard of hearing.

`Central Auditory Processing Disorder`

**Definition**: According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association:

- Auditory processing disorder (APD) is often described as greater than expected difficulty hearing and understanding speech even though no measurable hearing loss exists. Individuals with auditory processing disorders may act as though a hearing loss is present when in fact, hearing sensitivity is often within normal limits. APD is often confused with other disorders such as ADHD, language impairment, learning disabilities, social and emotional delays or cognitive deficits.

- APD is not the inability to hear. It’s the inability to interpret, organize, or analyze what’s heard. All the parts of the hearing pathway are working well. But parts of the brain are not.

**Characteristics**: People with Central Auditory Processing Disorder can have difficulty with, among other things, locating the source of a sound, understanding what someone is saying if the environment is loud or there are competing sounds, following spoken directions, learning songs or instruments, paying attention, responding in a timely way, or learning a new language. Behaviors can vary depending on the individual and the presence of other disorders.

**Demographics**: It is estimated that approximately 5% of the global population have Central Auditory Processing Disorder.

#### Barriers for People with Auditory Disabilities

From the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative and other sources:

- People speaking softly, or in large spaces without amplification such as through microphones.
- Unavailability of sign language interpretation.
- Environments that are loud or present competing sounds.
- Websites and other technologies that require voice for interaction or listening for understanding.
- Audio in videos and films that are presented without captions or transcripts.
- Media players that do not support caption, or options to control the volume, or the size and colors of captions.

## Deaf-blindness

### Overview

Deaf-blindness is a rare condition, that requires touch as the primary means of communication.

**Definition**: Deaf-Blindness is a sensory disability that includes both deafness and blindness. Most people who are deafblind are not completely deaf nor completely blind, and retain some hearing and sight capability.

**Characteristics**: A person who is both deaf and blind experiences all the characteristics of those two disabilities, with the added complexity that the absence of both vision and hearing severely limits the sensory input possibilities of the individual to just touch, smell, and taste. Of those senses, touch is the only viable method for complex communication. A deafblind person would need to learn braille to access text, and sign language to access conversations (the deafblind person would feel the hands of the other person signing in the conversation).

**Demographics**: The incidence of deaf-blindness is low. According to the World Federation of the Deafblind, between 0.2% and 2% of the world’s population is deaf-blind.

#### Barriers for People with Deaf-Blindness

- For materials such as books, menus and navigation aids, lack of printed braille.
- In websites and other technologies, lack of output to a braille keyboard.
- Lack of transcripts of video or audio materials made available in braille.
- Lack of tactile sign language interpretation.

## Speech Disabilities

## Overview

Speech disorders can range from mild slurred speech to the complete inability to move the mouth to speak. The ability to physically speak may be completely unrelated to the person’s language capabilities; they may be able to read, write, and understand language, even if their mouth structure or neuromuscular connections do not allow them to articulate. Speech disorders may be caused by or a side-effect of underlying disabilities. A person’s speech may improve, remain stable, or progressively worsen over time.

`Articulation`

**Definition**: According to Texas Children’s Hospital, articulation disorder is a speech disorder involving difficulties in producing specific types of sounds. Articulation disorders often involve substitution of one sound for another, slurring of speech, or indistinct speech. There are three categories of articulation disorders:

- A speech sound disorder: When mistakes continue past a certain age.
- A phonological process disorder: When there are patterns of not saying words correctly.
- A motor speech disorder: When a person has trouble moving muscles required to talk.

**Characteristics**: According to Stanford Children’s Health, characteristics can include:

- Leaving off sounds from words
- Adding sounds to words
- Distorting sounds in words
- Swapping sounds in words.

**Demographics**: Statistics from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders indicate that the prevalence of speech sound disorders in young children is 8 to 9%. By the first grade, roughly 5 percent of children have noticeable speech disorders, most of which have no known cause.

`Aphasia`

**Definition**: According to the National Aphasia Association definition, *“Aphasia is an impairment of language, affecting the production or comprehension of speech and the ability to read or write. Aphasia is always due to injury to the brain-most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals. But brain injuries resulting in aphasia may also arise from head trauma, from brain tumors, or from infections.”*

**Characteristics**: There are various types of aphasia. A person with aphasia may not be able to recognize words or understand what is being said, be unable to speak or have difficulty saying what they mean, difficulty forming sentences and omitting words.

**Demographics**: Statistics from the National Aphasia Association state that:

- There are at least 2,000,000 people in the USA with aphasia
- There are at least 250,000 people in Great Britain with aphasia
  
The global incidence rate is currently unknown.

`No Speech`

**Definition**: Having no speech, or mutism, is an inability to speak and can be caused by damage to the brain and / or speech muscles, by emotional or psychological reasons, or by a combination of causes.

**Characteristics**: Neurogenic mutism is often a manifestation of extreme forms of other speech disorders, including aphasia, apraxia or dysarthria. There are three types of psychogenic mutism: selective mutism, in which a person chooses not to speak, selective mutism, in which a person wants to speak but due to anxiety cannot in certain situations, and total mutism, in which a person does not speak under any circumstance.

**Demographics**: Selective mutism is estimated to affect 0.47 to 0.76 percent of the population. Statistics on the incidence of neurogenic mutism are unavailable.

### Barriers for People with Speech Disabilities

- Lack of text-based alternatives for speech communication.

## Mobility, Flexibility, and Body Structure Disabilities

### Overview

Mobility impairment includes people with upper or lower limb loss or disability, challenges with manual dexterity, disability in co-ordination with different organs of the body, or with a broken skeletal structure. Physical and mobility impairments cause limitations in independent, purposeful physical movement of the body or of one or more extremities. The alteration in the person’s mobility may be temporary or permanent. Disability in mobility can be congenital, acquired with age, or be the consequence of disease.

`Manual Dexterity/Fine Motor Control`

**Definition**: Fine motor skills are the intricate and detailed movements of the hand and wrist needed to manipulate, control and use objects, produce neat, legible handwriting, and dress independently. Fine motor skills involve the coordinated efforts of the brain and muscles, and are built on the gross motor skills that allow us to make bigger movements. Disability may be temporary, recurring, or permanent.

**Characteristics**: Some examples include difficulty tying shoelaces, inability to do up buttons or zippers, scribbly drawing, difficulty using a keyboard, poor handwriting, taking a long time to pick up small objects, manipulating objects in hand, or using both hands at the same time.

**Demographics**: Direct statistics are unavailable. However, according to the US National Institutes of Health, difficulties in fine motor skills are prevalent among children with Attention Deficit Disorder, which affects between 3 and 7 percent of children worldwide.

`Ambulation`

**Definition**: The Nursing Outcomes Classification defines ambulation as the ability to walk from place to place independently with or without an assistive device.

**Characteristics**: Impairments to a person’s ability to walk may be caused by congenital conditions, disease, or injury, such as cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disorders, amputation, arthritis, and back injuries.

**Demographics**: There are no specific statistics on ambulation disabilities. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, 3.5 percent of adults in the US have mobility disabilities.

`Muscle Fatigue`

**Definition**: According to the US National Institutes of Health:
Muscle fatigue is a common non-specific symptom experienced by many people and is associated with many health conditions. It is often defined as an overwhelming sense of tiredness, lack of energy and feeling of exhaustion, and it relates to a difficulty in performing voluntary tasks.

**Characteristics**: According to Healthline.com:
Muscle fatigue can occur anywhere on the body. An initial sign of this condition is muscle weakness, and other symptoms associated with muscle fatigue include soreness, localized pain, shortness of breath, muscle twitching, trembling, a weak grip, muscle cramps.

**Demographics**: There are no specific estimates of percentages of people affected by muscle fatigue, as it can be caused by a variety of factors, such as illness, age, medication and treatment side effects, inactivity, and depression.

`Body Size or Shape`

**Definition**: Body size or shape disabilities are disabilities caused by a variety of disorders that affect a person’s stature, proportions or shape. Examples include acromegaly, dwarfism, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity.

**Characteristics**: Characteristics depend on the cause of disability. Orthopedic conditions, such as arthritis and joint mobility, are frequently associated with the underlying cause. Other examples of co-occurring conditions include muscle weakness and fatigue, hearing loss, vision loss, cardiopulmonary disorders, and diabetes.

**Demographics**: Rheumatoid arthritis affects as much as 1% of the worldwide population. It is currently estimated that between 39 - 40 % of adults are obese.

#### Barriers for People with Body Size or Shape Disabilities

- Seating that is too small, or at the wrong height.

- Appliances and controls that are out of reach or require touch instead of voice commands.

- Steps, thresholds, and other obstacles to gaining entry to a space.

- Body shaming and social discrimination.

## Cognitive Disabilities

### Overview

Cognitive disabilities may occur on their own or result from a variety of conditions or injuries such as traumatic brain injury. They may also co-occur with other types of disabilities.

`Intellectual Disabilities`

**Definition**: Intellectual disability is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning, problem solving) and in adaptive behavior, which covers a range of everyday social and practical skills.

Note that definitions vary depending on the country. What are called intellectual disabilities in some countries are called learning disabilities in others.

According to the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, an individual has intellectual disability if he or she meets three criteria:

- Their IQ is below 70-75.

- There are significant limitations in two or more adaptive areas (skills that are needed to live, work, and play in the community, such as communication or self-care).

- The condition manifests itself before the age of 18.

**Characteristics**: According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children with an intellectual disability may:

- Sit up, crawl, or walk later than other children.
- Learn to talk later, or have trouble speaking.
- Find it hard to remember things.
- Have trouble understanding social rules.
- Have trouble seeing the results of their actions.
- Have trouble solving problems.

**Demographics**: It is estimated that between 1 - 3% of the global population, or about 200 million people, have an intellectual disability. The United Nations Development Program estimates that 80 percent of all people with disabilities live in low-income countries.

`Reading and Dyslexia`

**Definition**: Dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person’s ability to read. These individuals typically read at levels significantly lower than expected despite having normal intelligence. Although the disorder varies from person to person, common characteristics among people with dyslexia are difficulty with phonological processing (the manipulation of sounds), spelling, and / or rapid visual-verbal responding. In individuals with adult onset of dyslexia, it usually occurs as a result of brain injury or in the context of dementia; this contrasts with individuals with dyslexia who simply were never identified as children or adolescents. Dyslexia can be inherited in some families, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia.

**Characteristics**: Reading disabilities may include an inability to perceive text or to process the meaning of words, phrases and ideas. The disability may be the result of a congenital difference, injury, delayed development, neurological or physical disability. Some specific reading disabilities have been identified and are recognized by professionals by diagnosis, such as Dyslexia. Often the diagnosis of a learning disability will include components of a reading impairment.

**Demographics**: Dyslexia is thought to be one of the most common language-based learning disabilities. It is the most common cause of reading, writing, and spelling difficulties. Of people with reading difficulties, 70-80% are likely to have some form of dyslexia. It is estimated that between 5-10% of the population has dyslexia, but this number can also be as high as 17% and affects boys and girls in in approximately equal proportions.

`Math and Computation`

**Definition**: Math and computational disabilities impact a person’s ability to learn and communicate math. Dyscalculia involves an inability to understand arithmetic and how to calculate. This disability can be complicated by dysgraphia, an inability to draw or copy figures and graphs, and by anxiety. Dyscalculia may be congenital or result from an injury, disease, or aging.

**Characteristics**: According to Understood’s What is Dyscalculia and other sources, common signs of dyscalculia include:

- Trouble grasping the meaning of quantities or concepts like biggest vs smallest
- Understanding that the numeral 5 is the same as the word five, and that these both mean five items.
- Remembering math facts in school, like times tables.
- Counting money or making change.
- Estimating time.
- Judging speed or distance.
- Understanding the logic behind math or holding numbers in their head while solving problems.

**Demographics**: An estimated 3–6% of people have dyscalculia.

`Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder`

**Definition**: According to the Cleveland Clinic:

ADHD is a developmental problem characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Children with ADHD are easily distracted by sights and sounds in their environment. Symptoms usually appear by age 7. While people do not outgrow this condition, they do learn to adapt.

**Characteristics**: According to the Cleveland Clinic, the main symptoms of ADHD are:

- Inattention
- Distractibility
- Impulsivity
- Hyperactivity
  
**Demographics**: ADHD affects approximately 11% of the population.

`Autism Spectrum Disorders`

**Definition**: According to the World Health Organization:
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a range of conditions characterised by some degree of impaired social behaviour, communication and language, and a narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively.

ASDs begin in childhood and tend to persist into adolescence and adulthood. In most cases the conditions are apparent during the first 5 years of life.
Individuals with ASD often present other co-occurring conditions, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The level of intellectual functioning in individuals with ASDs is extremely variable, extending from profound impairment to superior levels.

**Characteristics**: According to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, people with ASD may exhibit some of the following traits:

- Not respond to their name by 12 months of age.
- Not point at objects to show interest by 14 months.
- Not play “pretend” games by 18 months.
- Avoid eye contact and want to be alone.
- Have trouble understanding other people’s feelings or talking about their own feelings.
- Have delayed speech and language skills.
- Repeat words or phrases over and over.
- Give unrelated answers to questions.
- Get upset by minor changes.
- Have obsessive interests.
- Flap their hands, rock their body, or spin in circles.
- Have unusual reactions to the way things sound, smell, taste, look, or feel.

**Demographics**: Worldwide, approximately one in 160 children has ASD, though it is reportedly higher is some countries, and its prevalence is increasing.

`Non-verbal Learning Disability`

**Definition**: According to the University of Michigan, Michigan Medicine resource, YourChild Development and Behavior Resources, Non-verbal Learning Disability:
Nonverbal Learning Disability is very much like Asperger Syndrome, in which people with the syndrome have normal intelligence and language development, but have trouble with social skills, sensory input, and making transitions. AS and NLD are generally thought to describe the same kind of disorder but to differ in severity, with AS describing more severe symptoms.

**Characteristics**: According to the University of Michigan, Michigan Medicine, some of the signs of NLD include:

- Great vocabulary and verbal expression
- Excellent memory skills
- Attention to detail, but missing the big picture
- Poor abstract reasoning
- Concrete thinking
- Physical awkwardness, poor coordination
- Poor social skills
- Trouble adjusting to changes
- Anxiety, depression, low self-esteem

**Demographics**: Studies estimate that around 1 in 100, or 1 percent, of children in the United States may have NVLD. It tends to affect boys and girls about equally.

#### Barriers for People with Cognitive Disabilities

From the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative and other sources:

- Complex sentences and unusual vocabulary.
- On websites and other technologies, complex page layouts and navigation.
- Long passages of text without images, graphs, or illustrations to help explain concepts.
- Animated, blinking, or flickering images.
- Audio with no option to turn it off.
- Web browsers and media players that do not provide a control to turn off animations or audio.
- Complex visual designs.
- Social isolation discrimination.

## Seizure Disabilities

### Overview

Seizure disabilities occur when a seizure disorder interferes with a person’s regular activities. Seizures can range from mild to severe, including loss of consciousness.

`General Seizure Disorders`

**Definition**: According to the Mayo Clinic:

A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It can cause changes in behavior, movements or feelings, and in levels of consciousness. If a person has two or more seizures or a tendency to have recurrent seizures, they have epilepsy.

**Characteristics**: According to the Merck Manual, depending on the type of seizure, symptoms during a seizure can include:

- Visual hallucinations
- An inability to speak
- Convulsions
- Loss of muscle tone
- Staring
- Falling down
- Biting the tongue
- Loss of control of the bladder or bowels
  
**Demographics**: About 2% of adults have a seizure at some point in their life. Two thirds of these people never have another one. Seizure disorders commonly begin in early childhood or in late adulthood

`Photosensitive Epilepsy`

**Definition**: According to Epilepsy Action:

Photosensitive epilepsy is a condition in which people affected have seizures triggered by flashing or flickering lights, or patterns. There are 2 groups of people who have photosensitive epilepsy: people who only have seizures triggered by flashing or flickering lights, or patterns (sometimes called pure photosensitivity), and people who have seizures triggered by flashing or flickering lights or patterns but also have seizures at other times.

**Characteristics**: According to Epilepsy Action:

- Different people will be affected by lights at different flash or flicker rates. Lights that flash or flicker between 16 and 25 times a second are the most likely to trigger seizures. But some people are sensitive to rates as low as 3 or as high as 60 a second.

- Different people may be affected by different types of pattern. Those patterns with a high contrast or some that move are more likely to trigger seizures. Some video games often contain potentially provocative light stimulation.
Demographics: Approximately 3% of people with epilepsy have photosensitive epilepsy

#### Barriers for People with Seizure Disabilities

From the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative and other sources:

- Activities in which a sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm, such as swimming, taking a bath, or using power tools.

- Driving.

- Moving, blinking, or flickering content in videos, films, websites, and other technologies.

- Web browsers and media players that do not provide controls to stop or turn off video or animations discrimination.

## Psychological / Psychiatric Disabilities
### Overview
There are many types of psychological and psychiatric disabilities, which include problems in a person’s perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

`Social Disabilities`

**Definition**: According to the US National Institute of Mental Health:
Social Anxiety Disorder is a disorder in which a person feels anxiety or fear in certain or all social situations, such as meeting new people, dating, being on a job interview, answering a question in class, or having to talk to a cashier in a store. Doing everyday things in front of people, such as eating or drinking in front of others or using a public restroom, also causes anxiety or fear. The person is afraid they will be humiliated, judged, and rejected.

**Characteristics**: According to the US National Institute of Mental Health, when having to perform in front of or be around others, people with social anxiety disorder tend to:

- Blush, sweat, tremble, feel a rapid heart rate, or feel their mind going blank.

- Feel nauseous.

- Show a rigid body posture, make little eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice.

- Find it scary and difficult to be with other people, especially those they don’t already know, and have a hard time talking to them even though they wish they could.

- Be very self-conscious in front of other people and feel embarrassed and awkward.

- Be very afraid that other people will judge them.

- Stay away from places where there are other people.

**Demographics**: The prevalence of anxiety disorders across the world varies from 2.5 - 7% by country. In 2017, an estimated 284 million people experienced an anxiety disorder, making it the most prevalent mental health disorder.

`Emotional Disabilities`

**Definition**: According to the Center for Parent Information and Resources:
Emotional disturbance is defined as a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree that adversely affects a child’s educational performance:

- An inability to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.

- An inability to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.

- Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances.

- A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.

- A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

**Characteristics**: According to the Center for Parent Information and Resources, some of the characteristics and behaviors seen in children who have an emotional disturbance include:

- Hyperactivity
- Aggression or self-injurious behavior
- Withdrawal
- Immaturity
- Learning difficulties

**Demographics**: The World Health Report-2001 showed the worldwide prevalence of emotional disorders was 6.2% among children ages 9-17.

`Behavioral Disabilities`

**Definition**: According to the US Department of Health and Human Services:

Behavioral disorders involve a pattern of disruptive behaviors in children that last for at least 6 months and cause problems in school, at home and in social situations.

**Characteristics**: According to the same source, someone who has a behavioral disorder may:

- Be inattentive
- Be hyperactive
- Act impulsively
- Act defiantly
- Use drugs
- Commit crimes
  
**Demographics**: Mental health problems in children are common throughout the world. According to estimates provided by the World Health Organization, 20% or one-fifth of children worldwide suffer with mental and behavioral disorders. Most are adolescents between the ages of 10-19.

World Health Report-2001 showed the prevalence of behavioral disorders was 10.3%, and emotional disorders 6.2% among children ages 9-17. At minimum, 3% of school-age children complain of severe depression, suicidal thoughts, psychosis and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders.

#### Barriers for People with Psychological / Social Disabilities

- Limited availability and affordability of mental healthcare services.

- Lack of knowledge among healthcare providers for accurate diagnoses and treatment.

- Social stigma.

## Multiple / Compound Disabilities

**Definition**: Multiple or compound disabilities describe the phenomenon of more than one disability being present within a person at the same time. They can include physical, mental, or a combination of types. In terms of education, this category is used for students with the most profound disabilities. It does not include deaf-blindness.

**Characteristics**: According to ProjectIDEAL, children with multiple disabilities typically show deficits in the following developmental areas:

- Intellectual functioning
- Adaptive skills
- Motor skills
- Sensory functioning
- Communication skills
  
**Demographics**: Global statistics are not available. The US Department of Education reported that of the 5.9 million students receiving special education services in the 2003-2004 school year, roughly 2% received special education services based on a classification of multiple disabilities.
